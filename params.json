The engine uses a block-based voxel-like approach as seen in Minecraft. After proving itself as a solid tech demo begla was joined at first by Anton \"small-jeeper\" Kireev and Rasmus \"Cervator\" Praestholm and a full-fledged game concept was born.\r\n\r\nThe creators of Terasology are a diverse mix of software developers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians. Get involved by checking out our [Community Portal](http://forum.movingblocks.net/index.php), our blog [Moving Blocks!](http://blog.movingblocks.net), and our [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Blockmania/248329655219905).\r\n\r\nTerasology is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) and available in source code form at [GitHub](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology).\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTerasology requires the latest version of Oracle's [Java Virtual Machine (JVM)](http://www.java.com/de/download/). Also make sure that your graphics card driver is up to date.\r\n\r\nYou can use one of the default launch scripts to start the game. The scripts will setup your JVM to allocate up to 1024 MB of heap space. Under Linux and Mac OS X the run script needs the access permission \"Execute\" to run properly: \"chmod +x script.sh\".\r\n\r\nControls\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* [W,A,S,D]               - Movement\r\n* [E]                     - Activate (Chest, TNT, etc)\r\n* [Space]                 - Jump\r\n* [Double Space]          - God mode (fly / no-clip)\r\n* [Shift]                 - Hold to run\r\n* [Left click]            - Activate left click action (default = place block)\r\n* [Right click]           - Activate right click action (default = remove block)\r\n* [Mouse wheel up/down]   - Cycle through toolbar slots\r\n* [1,..,0]                - Change the active toolbar slot\r\n* [I]                     - Toggle inventory screen\r\n* [F]                     - Toggle viewing distance (near, moderate, far, ultra)\r\n* [Tab]                   - Toggle developer console\r\n* [F3]                    - Toggle debug mode and information\r\n* [F4]                    - Different debug metrics\r\n* [K]                     - Don't try this :-)\r\n* [Escape]                - Show/hide the game menu screen\r\n\r\nDebug features \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nOnly works when the F3 debug mode is enabled (and may come and go)\r\n\r\n* [Arrow up/down]         - Adjust the current time in small steps\r\n* [P]                     - Activate first-person player camera\r\n* [O]                     - Activate animated spawning point camera\r\n\r\nExamples tools \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nMay move slot or disappear as development continues\r\n\r\n* Companion Cube          - Poorly hidden easter egg almost guaranteed to never talk with or attempt to stab you\r\n* Torch                   - Shiny!
